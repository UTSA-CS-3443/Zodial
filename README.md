# Zodial
Repo for team: Zodial

Zodial is a planner application that was created to make planning and staying on track easier!
To utilize the application, all that is needed is the use of GitHub, eclipse, JAVAFX, and of course internet access. 
To access and run Zodial, the user would need to clone a repository of the application from GitHub, then open the repository in eclipse,
making sure that both JAVA 9 and JAVAFX are included in the build path.
Once you have followed the steps to run and access the application, Zodial will ask new users to sign up, providing a username, password,
and first and last name, making it easy to log in.
Once the user has provided the following information, a user file will be created specifically for them, holding any event information 
created by the user.
When a user creates an event, the following information will need to provided in order to create the event: a title, description, location,
start time and end time, and a category selection. The category chosen will be shown by color in the dashboard, personal being a light blue,
work being a dark blue, kids activities being red, holiday being green, and other being yellow.
Once an event has been finished or if the user needs to modify the event, simply click on the event and click the ok button to deleter, modify
to modify the event, or cancel to go back to the dashboard.
Another neat thing about Zodial is that you can choose an avatar from the provided selection, simply click the edit button next to the
initialized avatar.
