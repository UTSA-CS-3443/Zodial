<b>Zodial</b> is a planner application that was created to make planning and staying on track easier!


To utilize the application, all that is needed is the use of GitHub, Eclipse, JavaFX, and of course internet access. 

***

##### Technology Requirements:
- Java 9
- JavaFX
- Eclipse

##### To access and run Zodial: 
- clone the <b>Zodial</b> repository from GitHub 
- open the repository in Eclipse
- ensure that both Java 9 and JavaFX are included in the build path

***

Once you have followed the steps to run and access the application, <b>Zodial</b> will ask new users to sign up by providing a username, password,
and first and last name, making it easy to log in.


Once the user has provided the following information, a user file will be created specifically for them, holding any event information 
created by the user.


When a user creates an event, the following information will need to provided in order to create the event:
- a title
- description
- location
- start time and end time (specify AM/PM) 
- category selection

<br>

The category chosen will be shown by color in the dashboard. Types of Categories available: 
- Personal (light blue)
- Work (dark blue)
- Kids Activities (red) 
- Holiday (green) 
- Other (yellow)

<br>

If the user needs to modify an event, simply click on the event and click the <b>Ok</b> button to delete, <b>Modify</b> to modify the event, or <bb>Cancel</b> to go back to the dashboard.

Another neat thing about Zodial is that you can choose an Avatar from the provided selection by simply click the edit button located next to the
image on the dashboard.
